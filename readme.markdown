## Public repository of all that I have learned or build (not necessarily up to date)

In this repository you will find all kinds of things with a simple but intuitive name in order to facilitate and better organize all. Import to remember that I will always recognize from where I learned so that you could check it out from the source. (Just because I did it one way does not mean that it's the only available or the better one)
